# Infinite Loops

## Branding

### Logo

TODO

### Mascot

Since our team name is **Infinite Loops**, we thought we could draw inspiration from **Avengers: Infinity War**. So we chose **Thanos** to be the mascot of our team.
Here is a picture of what we had in mind:

### Theme

With the same reasoning as above, the theme for our team is **Avengers: Infinity War** and we thought we could also incorporate some elements from fractals in our designs.

The introduction video of our team can be found here: [Video](videos/teamintro.mp4)

## Our Values

- Communication:
  - Responding to team mates in a timely manner
  - Being open, honest, and upfront by sharing project updates regularly, voicing concerns early, and discussing uncertainties as they arise
  - Reaching out for help whenever needed. Asking for help is a strength and an opportunity for collaboration and learning, not a weakness
  - Openly praising each other for efforts and achievements
  - Sharing constructive criticisms for areas needing improvement and missed opportunities
- Comraderie:
  - Promoting psychological safety within the team
  - Covering for each other during hard times
  - Helping each other out whenever needed
