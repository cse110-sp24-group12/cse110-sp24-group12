## Agenda

- Go over project updates
  - Designs on Figma
  - Scoped out tasks on GitHub
  - Markdown Renderer
  - ADRs CI/CD pipeline

## New Business to be Discussed

- The designs on Figma are looking good
  - the color scheme makes it a little hard to read the dates so we should fix that if we could
- The tasks are scoped out really well
  - Everyone is contributing to the repo which is a great sign
  - Members are assigned to tasks in pairs
- The ADRs are great and we don't need to change them. We are most likely fine for the second checkpoint as well.
- The CI/CD pipeline is looking good for the first checkpoint. For the second checkpoint, we are going to add an electron build process and e2e testing.
