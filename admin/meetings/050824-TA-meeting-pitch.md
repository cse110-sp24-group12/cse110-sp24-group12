  - scope
    - 4 weeks to complete, so we're focusing on core functions before anything else to maximize MVP impact
  - our purpose
    - design and build devjournal that allows effective productivity
- User persona
  - procrastinator is persona, not a story. 
- User stories
  - want this structure:
    - as a developer, i want to keep track of my daily task list, so that I can achieve my goal
      - role; dev
      - feature; to do list
      - effect/goal;
  - State feature list and respective categories
  - Note main competetors and their positive features and what is realistic for us to complete given the scope
  - Goals
    - local first
    - markdown support
    - minimalistic design in structure
    - customizable
    - accessible
      - for different devices
      - users with disabilities
  - accessibility
  - markdown support
  - Open-source Themes
  - Electron "wrapper"
  - Security - password protection
  - Wireframe and flow
  - Rabbit Holes
    - real-time edit; would be useful, but unrealistic for our scope
    - storing notes on cloud
    - Current feature
      - new library learning curves
  - Tools and tech stack
    - elevtom
    - markdown
    - exporting html
- Notes by TA
  - keep in mind user story structure, follow the "XYZ" format
  - Likes
    - electron usage
    - exporting html as pdf library
  - concerns
    - markdown rendering library; kind of basic, we want a more unique element to set us apart from other teams
  - suggestions
    - labels or sections to have a to-do for today, based on the deadline
    - labels to separate classes
    - dashboard
      - to see our poductivity over time
      - progress tracker
      - daily check-in
    - ability to have recurring tasks
    - priority filtering on the to-do list
    - something to incentivise using the app
    - error records and how you solved it in the past
    - summary for tasks
    - how can we make the user experience more friendly?
    - achievement system
    - reward system
      - caretaking system? lots of apps use the "take care of this plant or this animal"
    - we want something to flaunt and have positive reinforcement
      - prefer to have something green rather than red
      - negative reinforcement is less effective, you are put under more pressure and become less motivated
    - Get started as quickly as possible
    - we want to try to have an "x factor" so that we can have more weight behind our work; so that we show we've put more 
- Updates for next week's meeting:
  - have a schedule set
  - try to establish an "x factor" to help us stand out
