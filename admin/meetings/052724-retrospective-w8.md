## New Business to be Discussed

- What went Well?
  - Progress
    - All teams worked, successfully made their pull requests
    - pull requests could have been more lenient
  - Collaboration
    - pair programming playstyle has been working well
    - live work meetings have been helpful, especially with addressing roadblocks
- What didn't go Well?
  - Electron 
    - slow
    - have to save and run from terminal to test
    - using it poses a challenge, but also lets us stand out
  - Time
    - still difficult
- As a team, we've been working well and it's good that we've put an emphasis in our process to include everyone
  - we've noticed other teams struggle to maintain a good bus factor, but we seem to be managing well
- Week 10 "hacking" session?
    - all present in agreement
- Github contribution check-in -- everyone's been contributing consistently
