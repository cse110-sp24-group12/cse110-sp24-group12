N/A

## New Business to be Discussed

- Grading criteria for the project:
  - Features: of the tasks, how many did we cover
  - Process: Are we using GitHub properly and making the proper pull requests and project board
  - Quality: GitHub and framework setup, proper testing of all the functions, documentation
- Testing: The person writing the code should probably write the tests too since they are more aware of the details and the edge cases
- Documentation:
  - Every function should have some comments written for it
  - Any person reading the comments should have a decent understading of what the functions/code is doing
  - JS docs is probably a good choice for this
  - At least 2 people should review every pull request (with constructive feedback)
- Progression chart on the GitHub board should look pretty linear, not an exponential explosion towards the end of the quarter
- Stand-up meetings
  - We need to reserve a time slot
  - At the very least one team leader has to be present in these meetings
  - Discuss progress on the project in these meetings (Don't come with nothing to report)
- We need to assign one member to be the "designer"
