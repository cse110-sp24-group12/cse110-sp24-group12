<img src="assets/mascot-thanos.jpeg" alt="Mascot Thanos" width="200">

- Theme will be Infinity Wars since there are a lot of material to work with
- People should respond/react to messages within 24 hours
- Stand-up meetings with TA are optional for all members besides team leaders
  - We most likely won't have other weekly team meetings
- We will assign roles to people once we have a better idea about what the project is
- We will use Slack as our primary form of communication
