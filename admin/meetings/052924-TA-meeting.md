## Agenda

- Weekly stand-up updates
- Discuss wrapping up the project

## New Business to be Discussed

- Reviewing Pull requests was main focus this week
- Dashboard
  - Contribution chart is complete, but non-responsive
- Consider color scheme change
  - talk to professor about it, see what he says
  - generally want to avoid 
- **Whole project due Sunday, June 9th**
  - On github, files should be more clean by the time we submit (e.g. no cache files should be there)
  - individual grades of each personal will not affect whole project grade poorly
  - If some individuals need to be included or contribute more, there is still opportunity
    - get more involved in testing
    - presentation videos
      - team status video (actual project)
        - Mention our name in the video and team number at the beginning
        - should be technical
          - miro board, and everything that we included in our demo video
        - some creativity is encouraged -> "Sell the product"
        - timing: 1 minute for what we did in the "show-off" video
      - agile status video
- Exit interview dates TBD, there's a large amount of people that have to be interviewed
  - will be quick
  - largely will also rely on github contributions
    - won't necessarily be checked rigorously, just want to have commits throughout
- Hacking session
  - encouraged, this is common
  - don't do it one day before due
  - do it earlier in the week, so there is time left to work
  - remember that people are likely to be working on finals
