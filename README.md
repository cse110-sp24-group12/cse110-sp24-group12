# Infinite Loops Developer Journal

Welcome to the Thanos Developer Journal! Inspired by the formidable and balanced approach of the Mad Titan, our journal is designed to help developers keep track of their daily accomplishments, challenges, and progress. This project aims to provide a structured and efficient way to document your development journey, much like Thanosâ€™ methodical quest for the Infinity Stones. Whether you're conquering bugs, building new features, or refining your code, the Thanos Developer Journal is your companion in achieving balance and excellence in your workflow.

Also if you don't know who Thanos is, here is a picture:

## Dependencies used in this project

- `Electron`: We used Electron as the main framework for our web application because it allows us to have a more local-first approach and access the files in the local file-system. Read this [ADR](specs/adrs/050924-why-electron.md) for more on our reasoning behind this decision
- `markdown-it`: We used this library for real time markdown rendering of the users' journals. The reason we chose this library over others can be found in this [ADR](specs/adrs/050924-markdown-it.md)
- `markdown-it-task-lists`: the `markdown-it` library by itself doesn't render task lists but with this extension we'll be able to render them as checkboxes
- `highlight.js`: To render code blocks in different programming languages in markdown
- `crypto.js`: To encrypt and decrypt the password for security reasons
