## Context and Problem Statement

We want to protect user data and ensure user's personal information cannot be access by others.

## Considered Options

* Having password page
* Not having password page

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Having password page", because we can protect user's data and ensure that potentially sensitive information cannot be stolen and only access by the user.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

* Pro: Having a password to access personal data significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. 
* Pro: Implementing a password page can enhance user trust in your platform, as it demonstrates a commitment to protecting their personal and sensitive information.

* Con: Having to remember and regularly input a password can be inconvenient for users, potentially leading to a poor user experience
* Con: Whenever users forget their passwords, which can lead to lockouts or the need for password resets, increasing user frustration.
